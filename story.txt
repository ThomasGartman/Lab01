This is a story all about how 
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to tkae aminute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all coll
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scareed 
And said "You're moving with you auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

Nothing to do with Fresh Prince: I WILL NOT BE STOPPED! NOT BY YOU OR THE PROTOSS OR THE CONFEDERATES OR ANYONE! I WILL RULE THIS SECTOR OR SEE IT BURNT TO ASHES AROUND ME!
